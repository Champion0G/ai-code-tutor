# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements user password storage in the database without any hashing or encryption mechanisms. The passwords will be stored as plain text strings in the MongoDB database. This approach prioritizes development simplicity and direct password access over security considerations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want user passwords to be stored as plain text in the database, so that I can easily access and debug password-related functionality during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers with a password THEN the system SHALL store the password as plain text in the MongoDB database
2. WHEN a user updates their password THEN the system SHALL replace the existing password with the new plain text password
3. WHEN retrieving user data THEN the system SHALL return the password as plain text without any decryption or processing
4. WHEN authenticating a user THEN the system SHALL compare the provided password directly with the stored plain text password

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove any existing password hashing functionality, so that the system consistently uses plain text password storage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes passwords THEN it SHALL NOT apply any hashing algorithms like bcrypt
2. WHEN the system stores passwords THEN it SHALL NOT use any encryption or encoding mechanisms
3. WHEN the system validates passwords THEN it SHALL use direct string comparison without hash verification
4. IF existing bcryptjs dependencies exist THEN the system SHALL remove or bypass their usage for password operations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the user authentication API to work with plain text passwords, so that login functionality remains intact with the new storage approach.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to log in THEN the system SHALL retrieve the stored plain text password from the database
2. WHEN comparing passwords during authentication THEN the system SHALL use direct string equality comparison
3. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL proceed with normal session/token generation
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the user registration process to store passwords as plain text, so that new user accounts are created with the updated storage mechanism.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user registers THEN the system SHALL validate the password meets any length/format requirements
2. WHEN storing the new user THEN the system SHALL save the password exactly as provided by the user
3. WHEN the registration is complete THEN the password SHALL be retrievable as plain text from the database
4. IF password validation fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages without storing the user
